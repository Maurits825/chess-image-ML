TODO:
- 10k+ pics: use data flow thing from keras
- last commits is good accuracy, not overfitting i think because validation accrucary also increase

- to commit: added dropouts, 80% accuracy!

data set:
the lookat function doesnt add images with perspective wrap
dont have lookat func -- perspective wrap is there
problem:
	- only like 20% of img is actually piece, inifficient but works for now
	- upside down pieces now, could leave in for now?
	- need to add random rotation
