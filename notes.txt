multi-label classification
- output for each peice
- 64 labels for each square

black pawns
input: image
output: vector of labels
eg: [0,5,7] --> linear index of the square that black pawn is on

repeat process for p, n, b, r, q, k and for white P, N, ...
6 for black and white = 12 outputs

so either have a neural network with 12 outputs each outputing a vector of labels
or have 12 networks? each with a vector output

we need to have each network setup? all 12 pieces maybe? no because net independent
CEHCK ORDER? of black and white label vs peice and shiet - shouylnt matter, consitency does
simplify -- batchnorm - needed? get a simple model going
GOAL: 2 samples: 100% accuracry on both w/b p leggo
bathc size, loss and stuf -- change and test

binary accuracy the way to go?
is is overfitting pog, even at 1k samples i think
TODO: add drops out, test, try regu, test, then actually have a set to evaluate  the model on
